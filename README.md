# SLDS Linter

## Overview

SLDS Linter provides custom linting rules specifically built for Salesforce Lightning Design System 2 (SLDS 2 beta). SLDS Linter is designed to uplift your Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), Lightning Web Component (LWC), and Aura component files to SLDS 2 and to conform to SLDS best practices. SLDS Linter rules allow you to maintain consistent styling and identify common issues when working with Lightning components. 

## Features

* Component Linting:
  The utility supports linting for two types of Salesforce Lightning components:

  * LWC and Aura components.
    LWC Components (.html): Linting is applied to Lightning Web Components.
  * Aura Components (.cmp): Linting is applied to Aura Components.

- Stylelint for CSS Files:
  Stylelint rules are applied to .css files associated with the components. This ensures consistent styling practices are followed throughout the project.

Follow the below instructions to integrate SLDS Linter into your project.
