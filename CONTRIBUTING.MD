1. The [README](README.md) has details on how to set up your environment.
1. Create a _topic_ branch in your fork based on the correct branch (the **main** branch, see [Branches section](#branches) below). Note, this step is recommended but technically not required if contributing using a fork.
1. Edit the code in your fork.

## Branches

- Our released (aka. _production_) branch is `main`.
- Our work happens in _topic_ branches (feature and/or bug-fix).
  - feature as well as bug-fix branches are based on `main`
  - branches _should_ be kept up-to-date using `rebase`
  - see below for further merge instructions

### Merging between branches

- We try to limit merge commits as much as possible.

  - They are usually only ok when done by our release automation.

- _Topic_ branches are:

  1. based on `main` and will be
  1. squash-merged into `main`.

- Hot-fix branches are an exception.
  - Instead we aim for faster cycles and a generally stable `main` branch.

## Pull Requests

- Develop features and bug fixes in _topic_ branches.
- _Topic_ branches can live in forks (external contributors) or within this repository (committers).
  \*\* When creating _topic_ branches in this repository please prefix with `<developer-name>/`.

### Merging Pull Requests

- Pull request merging is restricted to squash & merge only.
